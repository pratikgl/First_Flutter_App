# WordPair

It is a WordPair generator app demonstrated in flutterâ€™s official documentation. The app has two versions. The first one is the basic one which consists of a page that is infinitely scrollable and generates random unique word pairs. The pro version of the app has a favorite button for every word pair, which on clicking saves the word pair. There is a favorite route on the app where a user could find all the saved word pairs.
